# Gilded Rose Kata
This is a modified version of Jim Weirich's [Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/jimweirich/gilded_rose_kata). It's based on [All the Little Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) by Sandi Metz, a talk she gave at RailsConf 2014.

I made this to help me follow along with her talk.
